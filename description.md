**Project Description**

Our project will support high school students who struggle with mental health. Our website will be an open resource available for students who want to find articles, contact therapists, or find simple solutions to find relief. High school is a time of lots of stress, anxiety, and with our website, we hope to aid high school students across the nation and support them so they can reach their highest potential!

**Project Sponsor**

Sirisha Guntupalli - Mental Hospital employee who wants to spread awareness about mental health targeted towards the younger generation to help teens and children who are struggling

**Project Hosting Plan**

For hardware, we obtained AWS, launched an EC2 instance, and downloaded the key or .pem file. We created a new Ubuntu server and will SSH into the server using the .pem file. We will set up Maven/Springboot. Next, we will check out a domain name at freenom.com. We will then connect Nginx to domain. Our frequency of deployment will be once per week. We plan to deploy from the main branch. To deploy, the deployment manager will pull from Github, check/update dependencies, and restart the service file. Our designated deployment manager is Gigi.
